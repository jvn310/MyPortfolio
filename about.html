    <h1>Tumelo Phatlane</h1>
    <h2>makes applications go bbrrr</h2>

    <p>This is the part where I tell you how amazing I am. Hey, my name is Tumelo and I am a young female tech enthusiast.
        I am passionate about creating applications out of nothing using code, fueling my creative and somewhat weird passions.
    </p>
    <p>
        My love for code started back in 2022 when I got introduced to BroCode, then I was hooked for life.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a big fan of anything and everything sci-fi, playing first-person shooter games, and music.
